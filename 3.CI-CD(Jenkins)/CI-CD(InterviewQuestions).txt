**CI/CD INTERVIEW QUESTIONS**
1)What is CI/CD, and why is it important in the software development process?
Ans:-
CI/CD, which stands for Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (or Deployment), is a set of practices that enable development teams to deliver code changes more frequently and reliably.
CI/CD automates the process of integrating code changes into a shared repository, testing it, and then delivering the changes to production, all in a streamlined and efficient manner.

2)Can you explain the key differences between Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment?
Ans:-Continuous Integration (CI): This involves the process of automatically building and testing code changes as they are committed to the shared repository. With CI, developers can identify issues early in the development cycle, leading to better code quality and reducing the likelihood of integration problems.

Continuous Delivery (CD): This extends the concept of CI by automatically deploying code changes to a testing or staging environment, making it ready for release. Continuous Delivery ensures that the software can be reliably released at any time, facilitating a faster and more predictable delivery process.

Continuous Deployment: This takes the process a step further by automatically deploying code changes to production once they pass all stages of testing and quality assurance. This is often used in scenarios where rapid deployment and frequent releases are crucial for the business.
